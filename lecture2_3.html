        <h1><u>Digitalisation</u></h1>
    </center>
    <h2>A fully digital enterprise</h2>
    <p class="dig">A fully digital enterprise is a company that has adopted a complete digital approach. Digital tools
        and technologies are used
        to conduct all business operations. Digital technologies <br> can increase performance, “by cutting maintenance
        time and costs” (Wei et al and Spremic , 2019).
        Digital technologies, such as Artificial intelligence and Internet of Things <br> empower companies to have a
        competitive advantag e i n the business
        sector.</p>

    <h2>Cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise</h2>
    <p class="dig"> Cyber threats endanger business’s as they are well thought out attacks that uncover technical
        vulnerabilities and challenge information security.
        A strategic plan to implement <br> protective measures to avoid cyber attacks is essential for business
        security. Small to medium
        enterprises may not have the resources to ensure such security. The risks <br> associated with SME’s have a
        negative impact on com pan y success,
        as it can lead to the loss in revenue and they may not be able to recover. Ultimately, smaller corporations <br>
        are more vulnerab le and it may be
        easier for an attacker to gain access to control systems.</p>

    <h2>Energy crisis experienced worldwide in 2022?</h2>
    <p class="dig"> Seeing that the electrical consumption in developed societies cannot match that of GDP growth,
        “utilities must operate, maintain , and
        modernize their systems without the benefit <br> of increased load based revenue to pay for it” (Wei et al and
        Spremic , 2019). Consequently,
        business are at risk of cyber attacks, climate change and the constant need to keep <br> up with the forever
        growing digital world. N evertheless,
        advances in technology have led to innovation and offer a new way to approach challenges and solve problems.
        <br> The global energy crisis has led to the increase in gas and electricity, causing pricing to go up.
        Enterprises are dependent on energy and
        therefore the lack of it can lead to their <br> downfall. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has made the crisis
        worse, prohibiting s ome countries from
        receiving gas supplies (Melville, 2022). Ultimately, the rise in energy costs <br> impacts business’s. In
        summary, the cost of pro duc tion has
        increased leading to an increase in revenue.
