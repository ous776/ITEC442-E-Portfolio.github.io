        <h1><u>Cyber Kill Chain</u></h1>
    </center>

    <p>The cyber kill chain is a model for understanding the stages of a cyber attack. It was first introduced by
        Lockheed Martin in 2011 and has since been widely <br> adopted as a framework for understanding how cyber
        attacks
        progress and how they can be stopped. The stages of the cyber kill chain are:</p>

    <ul class="list">
        <li>Reconnaissance: The attacker gathers information about the target, such as identifying potential
            vulnerabilities.</li>

        <li>Weaponization: The attacker creates a means of delivering the attack, such as creating a malicious email or
            exploit.</li>

        <li>Delivery: The attack is delivered to the target, such as sending a phishing email or injecting malware into
            a website.</li>

        <li>Exploitation: The attack takes advantage of a vulnerability in the target system.</li>

        <li>Installation: The attacker installs malware or other tools on the target system to give them persistent
            access.</li>

        <li>Command and control: The attacker establishes a connection with the target system and can issue commands or
            exfiltrate data.</li>

        <li>Actions on objectives: The attacker carries out their objectives, such as stealing data or disrupting
            operations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By understanding the cyber kill chain, organizations can better defend against attacks by identifying and
        disrupting the attack at an early stage.</p>
