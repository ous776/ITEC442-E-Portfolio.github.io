        <h1><u>Man-in-The-Middle Attack</u></h1>
    </center>

    <p>A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker intercepts and alters
        communications between two parties without their knowledge. The attacker intercepts and relays messages between
        the two parties, pretending to be the other party, and can read, modify, or inject new messages into the
        communication stream.</p>

    <p>There are several ways that an attacker can execute a MITM attack. One common method is to use a technique called
        ARP spoofing. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to map a network's IP address to its corresponding
        physical (MAC) address. In an ARP spoofing attack, the attacker sends false ARP messages to the other devices on
        a network, tricking them into associating the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device
        on the network. This allows the attacker to intercept and alter traffic intended for the legitimate device.</p>

    <p>Another common method for executing a MITM attack is through the use of a rogue wireless access point. A rogue
        wireless access point is a wireless access point that is set up by an attacker to mimic a legitimate wireless
        access point, in order to intercept and alter wireless traffic.</p>

    <p>A MITM can be used for various malicious activities. For example it can be used to steal sensitive information,
        such as login credentials, financial information, and personal information. In addition, it can be used to
        inject malware into the communications stream, or to launch other types of attacks, such as phishing or social
        engineering attacks.</p>

    <p>To prevent MITM attacks, it's important to use secure communication protocols and to be aware of the security of
        the networks and devices that you use. Using encryption, such as HTTPS or VPN, can help protect your
        communications from being intercepted and read. Also, being aware of the security of your network devices and
        using firewalls and intrusion detection systems, can help prevent your network from being exploited by an
        attacker.</p>

    <p>It's important to be vigilant in identifying and preventing these type of attack. Be skeptical of any unexpected
        request for personal information, and avoid clicking on any links or providing personal information unless you
        are certain that they are legitimate.</p>
