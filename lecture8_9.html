        <h1><u>Selecting an IoT infrastructure</u></h1>
    </center>
    <p>IoT stands for Internet of Things. It refers to the growing network of physical devices, such as smartphones,
        appliances, and vehicles, that are connected to the internet and can collect and share data. These devices are
        equipped with sensors and other technologies that allow them to communicate with one another and with external
        systems, making it possible to collect and analyze large amounts of data in real time.</p>

    <p>The IoT has the potential to revolutionize many industries and aspects of daily life, by making it possible to
        monitor and control devices remotely, automate processes, and make better-informed decisions. Some examples of
        IoT applications include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Smart homes:</b> IoT devices can be used to control lighting, heating, and other systems in a home,
            making it
            possible to adjust settings remotely and automate certain tasks.</li>
        <li><b>Industrial automation:</b> IoT sensors can be used to monitor industrial equipment and processes,
            enabling
            predictive maintenance and other efficiency improvements.</li>
        <li><b>Healthcare:</b> IoT devices can be used to monitor patients' vital signs, track their activity levels,
            and
            remind them to take their medication.</li>
        <li><b>Transportation:</b> IoT devices can be used to track the location of vehicles, monitor traffic patterns,
            and
            improve the efficiency of logistics operations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While the IoT has the potential to bring many benefits, it also raises important security and privacy concerns.
        Because the data collected by IoT devices can be sensitive, it is important to ensure that it is transmitted and
        stored securely. Also, the widespread use of IoT can lead to the generation of vast amount of data that can be
        overwhelming, creating need for efficient and powerful analytics and data management systems to extract useful
        insights.</p>

                    What would be a typical IoT infrastructure setup for our greenhouses?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sensors: These devices are installed within the greenhouse to collect data on various
                            environmental and plant-related factors, such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and
                            light
                            levels.</li>
                        <li>Gateway: This device serves as the hub for the sensor network, collecting data from the
                            sensors
                            and sending it to the cloud for storage and analysis. The gateway may also have the
                            capability
                            to perform local processing and decision-making based on the sensor data.</li>
                        <li>Cloud platform: This is the backend system that stores and processes the sensor data, and
                            provides the means for users to access and analyze the data. The cloud platform may also
                            host
                            applications that can be used to remotely control and monitor the greenhouse.</li>
                        <li>User interface: This could be a web or mobile application that allows users to access and
                            interact with the sensor data and control the greenhouse remotely.</li>
                        <li>Networking infrastructure: Depending on the size of the greenhouse and the desired level of
                            connectivity, this could include a range of technologies such as Wi-Fi, cellular, or
                            low-power
                            wide-area networks (LPWAN).</li>

                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>B) Constraints</th>
                <td>
                    What are some constraints we may be dealing with within our greenhouse operation?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Environmental conditions: Greenhouses rely on the sun for light and heat, so you will need
                            to
                            consider factors such as temperature, humidity, and light levels in order to create a
                            suitable
                            environment for your plants. You may also need to consider the impact of weather events such
                            as
                            storms or extreme heat.</li>
                        <li>Space constraints: Greenhouses are typically limited in size, so you will need to carefully
                            plan
                            the layout and use of space to maximize plant growth and productivity.</li>
                        <li>Resource constraints: Greenhouses require a range of resources such as water, nutrients, and
                            energy to maintain optimal growing conditions. Managing these resources effectively can be a
                            challenge, particularly in areas where water or energy are in short supply.</li>
                        <li>Labour constraints: Greenhouse operations often require a significant amount of manual
                            labour,
                            such as planting, watering, and harvesting. Finding and retaining skilled labour can be a
                            challenge,particularly in areas with a tight labour market.</li>
                        <li>Financial constraints: Running a greenhouse operation can be expensive, especially if you
                            are
                            starting from scratch or investing in new technology. You will need to carefully manage your
                            budget and consider the costs of materials, labour, and utilities in order to stay
                            financially
                            viable.</li>

    <p>To connect a sensors such as (humidity, motion, water leakage, gas, door sensor etc. ) to a mobile application,
        you would first need to connect the
        sensors to a Zigbee network. Once the sensors are connected to the Zigbee network, you can connect the network
        to the cloud using a Zigbee to cloud gateway. This gateway will handle the communication between the sensors and
        the cloud platform, sending data from the sensors to the cloud in real-time. The
        mobile application will communicate with the cloud platform using a RESTful API, the app will authenticate
        with the cloud and fetch the sensor data that it needs to display. On the app, you can visualize the data by
        displaying example humidity in real-time on various visualizations such as graphs or charts. Also,
        the app could allow user to interact with the sensors by sending commands to the device via cloud.</p><br><br>
